# CS-505-Natural-Language-Processing

## Overview
This repository contains various assignments and projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each task explores different NLP concepts, techniques, and models, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks for implementation and analysis.

## Files Description

1. **`HW01.ipynb`**: Covers foundational NLP concepts such as tokenization, word frequency analysis, and text preprocessing. The notebook includes a Python refresher, advanced Python features, and exploratory data analysis using libraries like `nltk`.  

2. **`HW02.ipynb`**: Focuses on text manipulation at the character level and building a sparse bag of words representation. It utilizes libraries like `nltk` and regular expressions for text tokenization, cleaning, and dictionary-based analysis.  

3. **`HW03.ipynb`**: Delves into constructing term frequency vectors and n-gram models (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams), analyzing their probabilities, and generating sentences. It also explores model evaluation and testing for n-gram-based predictions.  

4. **`HW05.ipynb`**: Explores word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe, analyzing semantic similarities and creating visualizations of word vectors.

5. **`HW06_P1.ipynb`**: Introduces sequence models such as RNNs and LSTMs, focusing on their application in NLP tasks like language modeling and text generation.

6. **`HW06_P2.ipynb`**: Expands on sequence-to-sequence models for complex NLP tasks like translation, delving into model architecture and training processes.

7. **`HW06_P3.ipynb`**: Fine-tunes advanced models to improve their accuracy on complex NLP tasks, focusing on optimization techniques and hyperparameter tuning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
